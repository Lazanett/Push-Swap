🔀 PUSH SWAP

Push Swap is an algorithmic project in the 42 curriculum that challenges you to sort a stack of integers with a limited set of instructions, while minimizing the number of operations. The aim is to produce a C program called push_swap, capable of generating the shortest possible program to sort the integers passed as parameters.

📜 PROJET DESCRIPTION

Manipulate two stacks named a and b, initially filled with integers in a.

Use a specific set of instructions to move items between the stacks and sort them.

Optimize operations to produce the shortest possible program.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

🌟 SKILLS DEVELOPED

Mastery of sorting algorithms and analysis of their complexity.

Use of linked lists to dynamically represent stacks.

Code optimization to reduce the number of operations.

Error handling and argument parsing in C.
